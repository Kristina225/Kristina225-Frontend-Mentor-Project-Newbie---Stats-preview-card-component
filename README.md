## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first project that I've created with a mobile-first workflow. It seemed easier to adapt the layout to desktop after creating it for the mobile version, so this is the workflow that I will adot for future projects.
I also practiced more working with background images.

### Continued development

The next projects will probably require knowledge of Grid, so I need to learn that.
I also need to read more about responsive images.
